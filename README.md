# Angular ??


### Angular Commands

```shell

    ng new <<project_name>>
    ng serve # start the project
    ng generate component component name 
    ng g c component name # other way to create components
```

If you have decided to go with a version over `16` you will have to **add** the ``no-standalone`` in the project creation command: `ng new app --no-standalone`

**Data Binding**: data binding is the process of comunicate ts classes with html templates through `{{ variableName }}` to show it in our UI.
